# OWASP Juice Shop Learning Journey Documentation

### 1. **Introduction to OWASP Juice Shop:**
   - **Definition:** The OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure web application developed for security training, awareness, and ethical hacking practice. It’s a modern web application with vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten and beyond, making it an excellent resource for practicing penetration testing and learning about web security.
   - **Key Concepts:**
      - *OWASP:* The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization focused on improving the security of software through open-source projects, including the OWASP Top Ten list of common security risks.
      - *Juice Shop:* A purposely vulnerable application designed to teach security concepts in a practical, hands-on manner.
      - *CTF (Capture The Flag):* A cybersecurity competition format where participants try to solve security challenges to capture "flags" (usually strings or tokens).
      - *Penetration Testing:* A simulated cyberattack against a system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
      - *Web Security:* The practice of protecting websites and web applications from various security threats.

### 2. **Setting Up OWASP Juice Shop:**
   - **Installation:**
      - **Docker:** The simplest way to run Juice Shop:
         ```bash
         docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
         ```
      - **Node.js:** If you prefer running it natively:
         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
         cd juice-shop
         npm install
         npm start
         ```
      - **Heroku:** Deploy to Heroku with one click using the Heroku button on the [Juice Shop GitHub repository](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop).
      - **Other Options:** Juice Shop can also be deployed on platforms like Azure, Google Cloud, and others. Refer to the [official documentation](https://owasp-juice.shop/) for more deployment options.

### 3. **Exploring the OWASP Juice Shop:**
   - **Accessing the Application:**
      - After installation, Juice Shop should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
      - Browse through the application as a regular user to understand its functionality, which includes browsing products, signing up, placing orders, etc.
   - **Understanding the UI:**
      - Familiarize yourself with the user interface, including the product listings, user account section, and administration panel.
      - Note the areas where user input is accepted (e.g., search bar, login forms) as these are common areas for vulnerabilities.

### 4. **Understanding Common Vulnerabilities:**
   - **OWASP Top Ten Overview:**
      - *Injection:* Attacks where untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query (e.g., SQL injection).
      - *Broken Authentication:* Flaws that allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.
      - *Sensitive Data Exposure:* Inadequate protection of sensitive data such as credit card numbers and authentication credentials.
      - *XML External Entities (XXE):* Vulnerabilities related to XML processing, where external entities are used maliciously.
      - *Broken Access Control:* Failures in enforcing what users can do in an application.
      - *Security Misconfiguration:* Incomplete or ad-hoc configurations that lead to security weaknesses.
      - *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):* Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
      - *Insecure Deserialization:* Flaws where untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application.
      - *Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:* Incorporating libraries, frameworks, or other components with known security issues.
      - *Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:* Lack of proper logging and monitoring that hampers the detection of breaches.
   
   - **Juice Shop-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
      - Juice Shop includes many other vulnerabilities beyond the OWASP Top Ten, such as CAPTCHA bypasses, admin panel exploits, and more.

### 5. **Hands-On Exercises:**
   - **Exercise 1 - Finding Basic Vulnerabilities:**
      - Start by exploring the website to find low-hanging fruits like improper input validation or exposed sensitive data.
      - Example: Use the search functionality and experiment with special characters to identify potential SQL injection points.
   - **Exercise 2 - SQL Injection:**
      - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities by manipulating input fields that query the database.
      - Example: Try entering SQL commands in the login or search fields to bypass authentication or retrieve hidden data.
   - **Exercise 3 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
      - Inject scripts into form fields or URLs to test for XSS vulnerabilities.
      - Example: Inject a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` payload in various input fields and observe if it gets executed.
   - **Exercise 4 - Authentication and Session Management:**
      - Examine how the application handles user authentication and session tokens.
      - Example: Try to manipulate session cookies to hijack another user's session or bypass authentication.
   - **Exercise 5 - Access Control Testing:**
      - Test whether users can access restricted parts of the application without proper authorization.
      - Example: Try to access the admin panel or perform actions as another user by manipulating URLs or session tokens.
   - **Exercise 6 - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
      - Check if you can access or modify data by changing IDs or other parameters in URLs.
      - Example: Attempt to view or edit another user’s profile by changing the user ID in the URL.
   - **Exercise 7 - Security Misconfigurations:**
      - Identify misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as verbose error messages, unnecessary services running, or default credentials.
   - **Exercise 8 - Advanced Vulnerability Exploits:**
      - Dive deeper into vulnerabilities like XXE, CSRF, or Insecure Deserialization, which might require more sophisticated techniques.
      - Example: Test for XXE by uploading malicious XML files if the application processes XML data.

### 6. **Capture The Flag (CTF) Mode:**
   - **Enabling CTF Mode:**
      - Juice Shop includes a CTF mode where you can solve challenges and capture flags as part of your learning.
      - Enable CTF mode via environment variables or use the [CTF platform](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/) provided by Juice Shop.
   - **Participating in CTFs:**
      - Work through the challenges presented in CTF mode, which are designed to guide you through the discovery of various vulnerabilities.
      - Track your progress and compare it against others in the community.

### 7. **Additional Exercises:**
   - **Exercise 9 - Vulnerability Scanning:**
      - Use automated tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto to scan Juice Shop for vulnerabilities.
      - Analyze the results and attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities manually.
   - **Exercise 10 - Remediation Techniques:**
      - After identifying vulnerabilities, learn how to fix them by applying secure coding practices, configuring security headers, and improving input validation.
      - Example: Implementing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   - **Exercise 11 - Monitoring and Logging:**
      - Set up monitoring and logging for the Juice Shop application to detect and respond to security incidents.
      - Practice reviewing logs for signs of attack attempts or other suspicious activities.
   - **Exercise 12 - Defense in Depth:**
      - Explore how multiple layers of defense can mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities. 
      - Implement techniques like input validation, output encoding, authentication, and proper error handling.
